# Why Hire a Presale Agent vs a Traditional Agent When Buying a Presale Condo or Townhome

When it comes to buying a presale property, the agent you choose can significantly impact your investment outcome. Here's why working with a presale specialist like Uzair makes a difference.

## Developer Relationships

Presale specialists maintain direct relationships with developers, providing:
- Early access to projects before public launch
- Priority unit selection
- Better pricing and incentives
- Insider knowledge on project quality

## Market Expertise

Unlike traditional agents who handle various property types, presale specialists:
- Track all active and upcoming developments
- Understand developer reputations and track records
- Know which projects offer true value vs. hype
- Can predict completion timeline risks

## Negotiation Power

Presale agents often negotiate:
- Extended deposit structures
- Buyer credits and incentives
- Assignment rights
- Upgrade packages

## Contract Knowledge

Presale contracts differ significantly from resale purchases. A specialist understands:
- Developer disclosure statements
- Completion date implications
- Cancellation clauses
- Assignment restrictions

## The Bottom Line

With over 80% of presale projects being overpriced or unsuitable for investment, having a specialist who knows which 20% to focus on is invaluable.

# Understanding Presale Deposits: A Complete Guide for Vancouver Buyers

One of the biggest advantages of buying presale is the deposit structure. Here's what every buyer should know.

## Typical Deposit Structure

Most presale projects in Vancouver follow a staged deposit schedule:
- Initial deposit: 5-10% at signing
- Second deposit: 5% at 90-180 days
- Final deposit: Balance to make 15-20% before completion

## Deposit Protection

Your deposits are protected by the Homebuyer Protection Act:
- Funds held in trust
- Insurance coverage requirements
- Developer obligations

## Strategies to Minimize Deposits

Uzair's approach focuses on:
1. Finding projects with lower deposit requirements
2. Negotiating extended deposit schedules
3. Maximizing the time value of your money

## What Happens to Your Deposit?

At completion, your deposit forms part of your down payment. If you've put down 20%, you may avoid CMHC insurance entirely.

# Presale vs Resale Condos in Vancouver: Which Is Right for You in 2025?

Choosing between presale and resale is one of the biggest decisions for Vancouver home buyers. Here's an honest comparison.

## Presale Advantages

- Lower upfront costs (deposit spread over time)
- Brand new with warranty
- Modern designs and amenities
- Potential for appreciation before completion
- Time to save for closing

## Resale Advantages

- Immediate occupancy
- Known product (you can see the actual unit)
- Established strata and building history
- No completion risk

## When to Choose Presale

Presale makes sense when:
- You have 2-4 years before needing to move
- You want to build equity with limited capital
- You're investing for appreciation
- You prefer new construction

## When to Choose Resale

Resale is better when:
- You need to move immediately
- You want certainty about the product
- You're risk-averse about completion delays

## The Verdict

For most investors and patient buyers, presale offers superior returns when you choose the right project. The key is working with a specialist who knows the market.
